(If you want to see the different kind of prompts templates that come with langchain for sql chain, you can check it out [HERE](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/chains/sql_database/prompt.py)). **So the question is, why do we need an Agent then?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is why**: As we explained on the prior Notebook, an agent is a process in which the LLM self-asks about what approach and steps to take, questions the validity of the results and if sure, provides the answer. The SQLDatabaseChain doesn't do all this analysis, but instead tries a one-shot query in order to answer the question, which is good! but not enough for complex questions. That's why it couldn't solve the part about nationwide, it needs multiple steps in order to solve the problem, one query is not enough.\n",
    "Notice that it did't pay atention to the prompt where we explicitly say to try two methods and reflect on the answer."
